# Project 4: Proposal

### App Name Ideas
- Palettable

### App Description
Palettable is a mobile app that allows users to discover different color palettes and generate their own color palettes by uploading or taking a picture of their surroundings. It utilizes the phone's built-in camera to capture and extract the prominent colors from an image to create unique color palettes.

### Inspiration
- Coolers.co

## MVP
- Discover page with randomly generated color palettes
- Generate page where user can take or upload a photo with their phone's camera and create their own color palettes

## Post MVP/Reach Goals
- User Authentication - logging in and saving favorite color palettes
- Add other user's generated palettes to the discover page

## User Stories
- As a web developer, I want to easily discover a wide variety of color palettes, so I can design my website with colors that I know look good together.
- As an interior designer, I want access to lots of color palettes, so I can choose from a lot of options when designing my clients' homes.
- As a smartphone user, I want to be able to take a photo of something that has nice colors, so I can find out exactly what colors they are.

## Technologies
- React Native - a framework for building native mobile apps
- Xcode - a software development environment that allows you to simulate your app on an iPhone
- `vibrant.js/node-vibrant`, `color-thief`, `react-native-palette`, Adobe Kulers - image color extraction
- `react-native-camera` - a camera component module for React Native
- COLOURlovers API - color palette API
- `hex-rgb`/`rgb-hex` - convert hex to rgb or rgb to hex
- Firebase Authentication - provides backend services, easy-to-use SDKs, and ready-made UI libraries to authenticate users
- `react-navigation` or `react-native-navigation` - nav bar

## Timeline

## Foreseen challenges/obstacles
- Learning React Native and Xcode to build a native mobile app
- Figuring out how to utilize the phone's camera - take photo, store photo, analyze photo, etc.
